Purpose
This application was created for my Software Testing and Quality Assurance course at MSU. The application is web facing and allows the user to navigate to 4 different sub_urls which are the following: /, /about, /BMI, /retirement. The default page is a home page that explains to the user how to operate the application. The /about page shows the math behind the application. The /BMI page calculates the users BMI and displays the calculation. The /retirement page calculates the users retirement savings and displays the calculation.
